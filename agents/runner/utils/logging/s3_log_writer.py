"""Per-trajectory S3 log-part writer (RLS-9434 — trajectory-logs dual-write).

The durable log sink (``api_logger.api_sink``) tees every non-ephemeral record
in here alongside its Postgres write. Records are buffered per ``trajectory_id``;
each full batch (``_PART_SIZE`` events) becomes one gzip-NDJSON *part* object,
PUT to S3 by a single shared background worker via the ``s3_log_parts``
uploader and the server-minted presigned POST policy. At finalization the writer
flushes the remainder and seals a ``manifest.json`` completeness marker.

Design notes
------------
- **State is keyed by ``trajectory_id``.** Under Modal ``@modal.concurrent`` many
  trajectories share one process/event-loop, so a single global buffer/counter
  would interleave prefixes. Everything hangs off ``_state[trajectory_id]``.
- **Single shared worker.** Mirrors ``api_logger``'s one-worker model. Part
  numbers are contiguous per trajectory (assigned when a part is accepted onto
  the FIFO queue), and a per-trajectory finalize marker rides the same queue so
  sealing observes every prior part for that trajectory.
- **Loud, never silent, never fatal.** A shed part (queue full), an upload
  exhaustion, or a refresh failure logs loudly + emits a metric and flags the
  trajectory so its manifest is left *unsealed* — the run keeps going and the
  reconcile sweep rebuilds from Redis. This is the deliberate opposite of
  the old bounded-queue silent drop. Durability never depends on this
  writer: every event is independently in the Redis live-tail stream.
- **Reactive re-mint.** The presign can expire mid-run (its ~6h lifetime is bounded
  by the server's rotating task-role creds), so on an upload/seal *failure* the
  worker re-mints a fresh policy via an injected callback (``register(refresh_fn=…)``,
  so this OSS module never imports internal platform code) and retries once, then
  sheds to the Redis backstop. No proactive expiry tracking.

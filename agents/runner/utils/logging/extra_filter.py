"""Trajectory-joinable log-extra keys, the durable-sink filter, and the durable row id.

agent_id / orchestrator_id (and their SCD versions) are constant per trajectory
and stored on the `trajectories` row, so they are recoverable by joining on
`trajectory_id`. The durable log sinks (Postgres `trajectory_logs`, S3 NDJSON,
the Redis live-tail) therefore exclude them from each row's `log_extra` rather
than persisting a redundant copy on every one of ~2B log rows.

Datadog intentionally does NOT use this filter: its sink forwards the whole
`extra` in the message body and is the one sink that cannot join back to
Postgres, so it is where per-step agent attribution actually lives.

`trajectory_log_id` lives here too, because it is minted into `extra` (see
`stamp_trajectory_log_id`) and then excluded from `log_extra` by the same filter.

    The Postgres sink and the S3 sink are independent loguru sinks that share no state,
    so each used to mint its own id for the same captured line. That made the two stores
    disagree about the id of the same row, which breaks two things:

    - `get_trajectory_log(trajectory_id, log_id)` is documented as "use after
      `list_trajectory_logs`". The reader picks its source per *read*, not per trajectory
      (one transient S3 error serves read 1 from S3 and read 2 from Postgres), so a
      caller can hand back an id the other store has never heard of.
    - ordering equal-`log_timestamp` rows by `(log_timestamp, trajectory_log_id)` — the
      natural fix for S3 and Postgres returning ties in different orders — cannot work
      while the tiebreaker column differs per store.

    Stamping at capture is what makes the id shared: it must NOT come from either sink,
    because the S3 sink is gated on its own toggle specifically so it keeps working once
    Postgres logging is off. Sinks fall back to minting locally if the key is absent,
    which degrades to the old behaviour rather than writing a row with no id.

    Only lines carrying a `trajectory_id` are stamped — the durable sinks all no-op
    without one, so framework noise and stdout-only lines don't pay for a uuid.

    """Flush pending log messages, then close the API/file sinks once every
    concurrent trajectory in this container has finished.

    Closing the sinks early (while a sibling call under @modal.concurrent is
    still logging) would drop that sibling's remaining log lines. Only
    logger.complete() runs on every call; the actual sink teardown — which
    drains the API log queue's background HTTP worker and closes the file
    handle — waits for the last in-flight trajectory so pending logs are
    still shipped before a single-use container is destroyed.

    Args:
        trajectory_id: when given, finalizes this trajectory's per-prefix work
            now that it's done. Both steps below are per-trajectory and run on
            *every* call — before the shared ref-count teardown — not once per
            container, and ``logger.complete()`` above guarantees this
            trajectory's records have already reached the sinks:
            - S3 log parts (RLS-9434): flush the remaining buffer + seal the
              manifest (records reached api_sink → the S3 writer's buffer).
              No-op when S3 writing wasn't enabled (no policy minted).
            - Redis live-tail: collapse that trajectory's stream to a short TTL
              (full logs are already durable via the API sink). Each trajectory
              owns its own stream key regardless of how many share this container.

    The CAS ledger drains first, on *every* call rather than once per container.
    This is the only seam every exit path shares -- the CLI reaches it through
    ``run_and_persist``, and modal_labs / k8s_worker / harbor call it directly --
    so anywhere else would leave production draining nothing. Draining per
    trajectory rather than behind the ref-count is deliberate: a sibling still
    running is no reason to sit on this trajectory's events while the container
    waits to be reaped. Ordering matters too, since the drain reports dropped
    events by logging, and ``logger.complete()`` below is what ships that line.

    a row describes. Parity is enforced here rather than at each call site: the
    columns are only jointly meaningful (the id is what you ``GROUP BY``, the
    cipher is what lets a resolver later NAME that id), and a row carrying one
    without the other is a resolver gap that looks like data.

    ``key_hint_cipher`` is a reversible, asymmetrically-encrypted copy of the
    key, decryptable only by whoever separately holds the matching private key
    -- which nothing in this process ever has. It has been populated in
    production since 2026-08-23; emitting it for a shared gateway credential is
    deliberate parity with that, not a new exposure. Splat into
    ``record_cas_success``/``record_cas_failure``.

    Note this is a COARSER identity than the per-deployment credential the
    proxy resolves server-side and stamps as ``x-cas-credential-id``: every
    call through one gateway lane fingerprints identically. That remains an
    accepted trade -- the alternative it was weighed against is NULL, not a
    finer credential.

    Empty dict when nothing is resolvable, so a splat adds no kwargs at all
    rather than explicitly writing NULLs. That includes a missing
    ``CAS_KEY_HMAC_SALT``, which is logged once by the fingerprint step.

    Never raises. Both derivations document that themselves, but this is called
    from a ``finally`` block that owes the LLM call a soft failure, and OUTSIDE
    the emitters' own try/except -- so the guarantee has to hold here rather
    than being inherited from a pinned dependency. An attribution helper must

    Convert MCP content blocks to a single LiteLLM tool message.

    Each tool_use must have exactly one tool_result. This function combines all
    content blocks into a single tool message to satisfy API requirements for
    Anthropic, OpenAI, and other providers.

    For non-Anthropic models, images cannot be embedded in tool results, so they
    are appended to deferred_image_messages as user messages. The caller is
    responsible for adding them to self.messages after all tool responses.
    This list is mutated in place.

    Args:
        content_blocks: MCP content blocks from tool result
        tool_call_id: The tool call ID to associate with the result
        name: The tool name
        model: The model being used
        deferred_image_messages: Mutable list that image user messages are
            appended to (mutated in place). Callers should extend self.messages
            with this list after all tool responses are added.
        downscale_images: When True and model is Anthropic, downscale tool images
            to 2000px max dimension (for 20+ image conversations). Ignored for
            non-Anthropic models.
        max_image_bytes: Base64 byte cap for non-Anthropic tool images. Images
            over this budget are re-encoded/compressed to fit instead of being
            sent raw (which 400s on endpoints with a per-asset size cap, e.g.
            "Asset is too large"). When None (default), the cap is resolved
            per-model via NON_ANTHROPIC_IMAGE_B64_CAPS — only endpoints with a
            known small cap are compressed; all other non-Anthropic providers
            send raw (unchanged behavior). Ignored for Anthropic models (which
            cap via the Anthropic-specific normalizer).
        strip_images: When True, images are dropped entirely — never embedded in
            the tool result and never deferred — and replaced with a text
            placeholder. Set by a caller for a model that cannot consume images
            (e.g. a known text-only endpoint), so it proceeds on the text.

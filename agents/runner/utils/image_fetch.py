"""Fetch remote image URLs and re-encode them as data: URLs.

CLI-wrapping agent harnesses (codex_agent, claude_code_agent, gemini_cli_agent,
cursor_agent, …) all share the same problem: the CLI's image-input flag takes a
local file path, but task definitions in Studio commonly embed images as
`image_url` blocks with remote URLs (presigned S3, https). Rather than each
MCP server doing its own outbound HTTP — which would multiply SSRF surface,
egress policy, streaming/timeout handling, and per-protocol error handling —
this helper resolves remote URLs to base64-encoded data URLs on the harness
side. The MCP servers then only need to decode the data URL and write bytes
to disk.

The 5MB-per-image cap matches Codex CLI's documented soft guideline and is
a reasonable upper bound for the model context budget of any vision model.

    Save trajectory results by reporting to RL Studio.

        trajectory_id: The trajectory ID
        output: The agent run output
        snapshot_id: The S3 snapshot ID (None if not created)
        post_populate_snapshot_id: S3 snapshot captured after populate hooks run (None if no hooks)
        env_image_layer_s3_uri: S3 URI of the captured rootfs layer (None if
            capture is disabled or failed); triggers the env image build
        parent_fs_images: Modal directory-snapshot images captured per subsystem
            root (None if disabled or the capture failed); the server registers
            each so a continuation can mount this snapshot instead of
            downloading it. Rides this webhook rather than a new endpoint,
            exactly as `env_image_layer_s3_uri` does.
        datadir_images: Modal images of a running service's own state directory
            (None if disabled or the capture failed), registered under
            `service_state/<state_dir>` so a branch can mount a LOADED datadir
            and let the connector's own guard skip its seed import. Separate
            from `parent_fs_images` because it is not a half of the snapshot:
            nothing downloads it, and it registers without an S3 listing.

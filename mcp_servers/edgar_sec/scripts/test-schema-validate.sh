# SSOT: legacy — decided 2026-07, parked ENV-187 (no port). The repo-local validator invoked below is the single schema-validation ruleset for this app (no JSON port).
# Accept/reject gate for the EDGAR SEC offline-data seed.
#
# The studio seed-generation pipeline runs this script as its accept gate
# against the generated bundle (`bash scripts/test-schema-validate.sh <seed_dir>`);
# the mise [tasks.test-schema-validate] task delegates here too. It wraps
# scripts/validate_seed.py, the structural validator documented in
# schemas/README.md. No SEED_SCHEMA_MANIFEST marker is emitted, so the
# pipeline treats this script's exit code as the verdict (0 = clean, non-zero
# = rejected).

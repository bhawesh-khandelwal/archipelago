sandbox.py - LD_PRELOAD-based filesystem sandboxing for code execution

This module provides sandboxed execution using the sandbox_fs.so LD_PRELOAD library.
It intercepts libc filesystem calls to block access to specified paths while allowing
normal operations elsewhere (including package installation).

Usage:
    from utils.sandbox import run_sandboxed_command

    result = run_sandboxed_command(
        command="python script.py",
        timeout=30,
        blocked_paths=["/app", "/.apps_data"],
    )

# Modal/S3 recon vars). The additions below close those families. We avoid
# over-broad tokens like a bare "KEY"/"ARN"/"ENV"/"DD_" that would scrub benign

    Two modes, selected by the ``CODE_EXEC_RUN_AS_USER`` env var:

    * **run-as-user** (env set): the command runs as an unprivileged user via
      ``runuser``. Isolation is kernel-enforced file permissions — the user
      can't read root-owned ``/app`` / ``/.apps_data`` — which, unlike the
      LD_PRELOAD shim, the model cannot disable by clearing an env var. No
      sandbox library is required in this mode.
    * **LD_PRELOAD** (env unset, the default): the original behavior — load
      ``sandbox_fs.so`` to block configured paths, failing closed if the
      library is missing. Byte-identical to before for existing consumers.

    Uses ``start_new_session=True`` for clean timeout handling.

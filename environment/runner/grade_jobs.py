"""Async (start + poll) shape for the in-container grade, beside the blocking one.

`POST /grade` is held open for the whole grade, and Modal's connect-token
sandbox proxy closes a request that produces no response for ~5 min. A grade
runs every verifier and an LLM judge, so it passes that easily. `/grade/start`
launches it as a background task and returns a `job_id`; the caller polls
`/grade/status/{job_id}` with short requests until it finishes. Exactly the
shape `data/populate/jobs.py` already uses, and for the same reason.

The blocking `POST /grade` is unchanged. hosted-envs calls it from its own
servicer, which does not go through that proxy, and nothing about that path
needs to move.

Both routes hand the same `GradeRequest` to the same `_grade` coroutine under
the same lock, so the request model, the SSRF boundary on snapshot URLs, the
credential allowlist and the root-owned scratch dir are the ones already
written in `grade.py`.

State is per-process and lives for the sandbox's lifetime. There is at most one
grade per sandbox, so a module-level dict is sufficient; no eviction.

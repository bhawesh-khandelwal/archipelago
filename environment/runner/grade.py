"""In-container grading: run the grading engine against the LIVE sandbox state.

``POST /grade`` grades the episode IN the same container it ran in, against the live filesystem —
no dispatch to the separate Modal grading lane, no snapshot round-trip, no queue. It captures the
live ``filesystem`` + ``.apps_data`` (streamed to a temp file), writes the caller-supplied grading
config to temp files, and runs the grading engine's CLI (``runner.main``) as a SUBPROCESS in its own venv, then
returns the parsed result. It never persists — the caller (the hosted-envs servicer) records it in
Studio. Signature-protected automatically: ``/grade`` is not in ``_SIGNING_EXEMPT_PATHS``.

Why subprocess (not in-process import): the grading engine's package is ALSO named ``runner`` (it
imports itself as ``from runner.main import …``), so it cannot be imported alongside this env runner
(also ``runner``) without renaming its whole package. Running it in its own venv via the CLI —
exactly how GDM docker worlds run ``score.command`` — sidesteps the collision and keeps this endpoint
free of any grading-package import (the config is opaque JSON, passed straight to the CLI as files).

PACKAGING (deploy-gating): the grading engine is MOUNTED into the sandbox as a Modal Volume at
``/app/grading`` (see hosted-envs ``sandbox.py`` / ``grading_volume.py``) — NOT baked into the shared
platform image. Its interpreter is ``GRADING_VENV_PYTHON`` (default below), with ``runner.main``
importable there; ``grade()`` creates ``GRADING_WORK_DIR`` (default ``/app/.grading``, root-owned
``0700``) inside the model-denied ``/app`` tree so the rubric scratch inherits the two-user boundary.

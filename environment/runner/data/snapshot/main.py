"""Snapshot subsystems to S3 or stream as tar.gz.

This module handles creating tar.gz archives of subsystem directories and
either uploading them to S3 or streaming them back as HTTP responses.
Currently snapshots include only 'filesystem' and '.apps_data' subsystems.

The implementation can stream tar.gz data directly to S3 using multipart upload,
or stream it back as an HTTP response, allowing it to handle TB-scale snapshots
without loading everything into memory.

There are two S3 upload modes:
1. tar.gz archive: Single compressed file
2. Individual files: Preserves directory structure

Also supports pre-snapshot hooks that run shell commands before creating the archive.

    Files >= 20 MiB stream from disk via ``upload_file``; smaller files use a

    Concurrency is capped at 8 files. Per file, bytes in flight are the queue
    (``max_io_queue`` x ``multipart_chunksize`` = 200 MiB) PLUS one part body
    per uploader coroutine, since ``upload_fileobj``'s uploaders pop the body
    off the queue and hold it for the duration of the PUT
    (``max_concurrency`` x ``multipart_chunksize`` = another 200 MiB), plus the
    reader's part-in-progress. Counting only the queue understates it ~2x.

    So ~400 MiB per file and ~3.2 GiB across the 8-file gate. Measured, not
    derived: 8 concurrent 1.2 GB uploads peak at 3198 MB RSS, against 2661 MB
    for the pre-retune config. The retune therefore RAISES the realized floor
    by ~20% and lowers the ceiling by ~5x — main's 100-deep queue tops out at
    2.2 GiB per file (17.6 GiB across the gate) and only stays under that
    because a fast link keeps the reader from ever filling it. A slow or wedged
    upload is precisely when it would fill, which is the case this path already
    OOM'd on at 20 concurrent uploads.

    *progress* is advanced as parts land so the watchdog can tell a slow
    upload from a wedged one, and is restarted at the top of every attempt
    because a retry re-sends the file from byte zero.

    Transient S3/network errors are retried up to ``_UPLOAD_MAX_RETRIES`` times

    """Upload all subsystem files individually to S3.

    Entry point for the /data/snapshot/s3?format=files endpoint. Runs any
    pre-snapshot hooks first, then uploads each file from 'filesystem' and
    '.apps_data' subsystems individually to S3, preserving directory structure.
    This format is compatible with grading and snapshot diffing which expect
    individual files.

    Files are uploaded to:
    s3://{bucket}/{prefix}/{snapshot_id}/filesystem/...
    s3://{bucket}/{prefix}/{snapshot_id}/.apps_data/...

    The snapshot includes a unique ID and can be called multiple times
    to create incremental snapshots of the environment state.

    Implementation notes:
    - Uses concurrent uploads (up to 10 parallel) for speed
    - Files < 20 MiB use single PUT; larger files use multipart upload_file
    - Per-file transient errors are retried with jittered backoff
    - Failed files are retried as a batch after the first pass completes

    Args:
        snapshot_id: Optional unique identifier for this snapshot, preallocated
            by caller
        pre_snapshot_hooks: Optional list of hooks to run before creating snapshot
            (e.g., database dumps)
        snapshot_zip_enabled: When True, also build a prebuilt single-ZIP copy
            of the snapshot for one-GET grading downloads (per-world gated)
        exclude_globs: Optional fnmatch patterns tested against each file's
            archive name; matching files are excluded from the snapshot
        mounted_subsystems: Subsystem roots that are LIVE 9p image mounts at
            capture time, so their files get the widened per-attempt upload
            budget. Only the caller knows this — mounting is a Modal
            control-plane call made from the agent process, invisible from in
            here. Omitted means "everything is local disk", which is what every
            unmounted run and every caller older than this field reports.
        job_deadline_seconds: How long the caller polls before abandoning the
            job, used to bound the widened budget so a file's retry sequence
            cannot outlive it. See ``slow_read_ceiling``.

    Returns:
        SnapshotFilesResult containing:
        - snapshot_id: Unique identifier for this snapshot
        - files_uploaded: Number of files uploaded
        - total_bytes: Total size of all files uploaded

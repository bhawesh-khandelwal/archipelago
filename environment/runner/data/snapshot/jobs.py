"""In-memory registry for background (async) snapshot jobs.

A single blocking ``POST /data/snapshot/s3`` is held open for the entire
harvest (pre-snapshot hooks + S3 upload), and Modal's connect-token sandbox
proxy closes a request that produces no response for ~5 min — which a
large-world snapshot (multi-GB ``.apps_data`` export + upload) easily
exceeds. To avoid that, ``/snapshot/s3/start`` launches the snapshot as a
background task and returns a ``job_id``; the caller polls
``/snapshot/s3/status/{job_id}`` with short requests until it finishes.

The synchronous ``POST /data/snapshot/s3`` route is unchanged — small worlds
keep using it, and it is the 404 fallback for callers newer than this image.

State is per-process and lives for the sandbox's lifetime. Snapshots happen
at most a few times per sandbox (post-populate + final), so a plain
module-level dict is sufficient; no eviction. Mirrors ``..populate.jobs``.

    Called when the poller gives up (its deadline expired). The caller releases
    the per-playground lock that serializes snapshots the moment this returns,
    so a harvest still running at that point would overlap the next one against
    an env that rejects concurrent snapshots — the exact race the lock exists to
    prevent.

    That is why this awaits the task rather than just cancelling it.
    ``Task.cancel()`` only *requests* cancellation: the coroutine keeps running
    until its next suspension point, and a hook subprocess can be mid-flight for
    a while yet. Returning right after the request would make the HTTP response
    mean "asked to stop", which is not what the caller needs to hear before
    dropping the lock.

    One honest limit on that guarantee: it covers the ``await``-ing work, which
    is all of the S3 traffic (aioboto3) and the hooks. It does **not** cover the
    prebuilt-ZIP build, which runs under ``asyncio.to_thread`` — cancelling that
    future resolves the awaiting coroutine at once while the worker thread keeps
    compressing, and ``_upload_snapshot_zip``'s ``finally`` then unlinks the temp
    archive out from under it. So on a zip-enabled world the sandbox may still be
    burning CPU and disk briefly after this returns. Harmless for S3 correctness
    (the archive upload comes after the build and simply doesn't happen), but the
    caller is not entitled to assume the box is idle.

    The wait is bounded — a thread that ignores cancellation must not hold the
    caller's request open past its own timeout — and a job that outlives the
    grace is logged loudly, since the overlap window is then genuinely open.

    Marking the job terminal also means a late poll reads ``error`` instead of
    ``running`` forever. Whatever partial objects the harvest wrote are orphaned
    under a snapshot_id no row will ever reference.

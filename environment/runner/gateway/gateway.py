    Renaming only ``Tool.name`` is not enough — a description that says "use

    anyway, and cross-references between tools leak each other's names. So the
    same substitution runs over every tool's description, using the WHOLE
    alias map rather than just that tool's own entry.

    Name boundaries do the heavy lifting, so a short tool name cannot corrupt
    a longer one's mentions: ``read`` will not match inside
    ``read_document_content``. They are spelled as ``(?<![\\w-])`` /
    ``(?![\\w-])`` rather than ``\\b`` because ``TOOL_ALIAS_NAME_RE`` admits
    hyphens and ``-`` is NOT a word character — ``\\bget-user\\b`` happily
    matches inside ``get-user-profile``, rewriting an unaliased sibling into a
    tool that does not exist (Bugbot: "Hyphenated names break rewriter
    boundaries"). The character class is exactly the name alphabet, so a
    boundary here means "not in the middle of a name". Alternatives are
    ordered longest-first so a ``{server}_``-prefixed form wins over its own
    bare suffix.

    Known cost, accepted: a tool whose canonical name is an ordinary English
    word (``search``, ``finish``) will have that word rewritten wherever it
    appears in its prose, which can read slightly oddly. Leaving it would be a
    leak, and the model seeing the real word is exactly what aliasing is meant

# --- Stateful (session-affine) gateway proxy ----------------------------------
# A serving server can opt into session affinity (default off). When set, the
# gateway connects ONE StatefulProxyClient for THAT server and reuses its session
# for every tool call, so the browser's page/refs/cookies survive across calls
# instead of resetting to about:blank. The connect must run in a long-lived owner
# task, never an inbound request task, or its streamable-HTTP cancel scope is
# orphaned when the request ends and crashes the next reuse. Affinity is scoped
# per server, never world-wide: a session connected outside a request never
# carries the per-call `Authorization: Bearer <actor_id>` rewrite, so sweeping a
# tenancy-enforcing backend (e.g. the email app) into the affine path breaks it
# with "Missing Authorization: Bearer <user_id> header." on every call.
#
# WARNING — this session-affine path depends on UNDOCUMENTED fastmcp internals. Do
# not upgrade fastmcp without re-validating ALL of the following against the new
# version:
#   1. StatefulProxyClient.__aexit__ is a no-op, so fastmcp's per-call nesting_counter
#      accumulates and never decrements (the reconnect logic below exists solely to
#      recover from the error this causes when a backend session later drops).
#   2. Client._connect raises a RuntimeError containing `_NESTING_COUNTER_ERROR` when a
#      session is (re)started with the counter != 0 — the exact reconnect trigger.
#   3. create_proxy() reuses a *connected* client's session for every call because
#      `type(client) is ProxyClient` is False for this subclass. This is what actually
#      defeats about:blank, and a regression here is SILENT (no error, just a broken
#      browser), so it is the most dangerous of the three to miss.
# fastmcp moves these between minor releases (3.4.2 already split the distribution into
# fastmcp + fastmcp-slim). The env pins 3.2.0 but the specifier is unbounded
# (`fastmcp>=3.2.0`) and the same monorepo already runs 3.4.2 in hosted-envs/uv.lock.
# On any bump, re-run the session-reuse + drop-recovery tests in test_mcp_gateway.py:
# they fail-closed on (1) and (2), but NOT reliably on (3) — verify (3) by hand.

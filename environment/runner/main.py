"""
FastAPI gateway server for an RL environment.

This server provides endpoints for managing a headless RL environment:

- /health - Health check endpoint to verify server readiness
- /data/populate - Load data from S3-compatible storage into subsystems
- /data/snapshot - Create snapshots of all subsystems and upload to S3
- /apps - Configure MCP servers (hot-swap MCP gateway)
- /mcp - MCP gateway endpoint for LLM agents (mounted dynamically)

The server is designed to run inside a Docker container with a timeout,
allowing external systems to manage the environment lifecycle.

    # world directories `download_objects` creates under `/.apps_data` land `0o2755`
    # (group cannot write) rather than `0o2775` — nothing repairs modes outside
    # `FILESYSTEM_ROOT`, so the umask alone decides it. Rationale and the launcher
    # inventory: PR #18377.
    #
    # In the lifespan, not at import: `os.umask` is process-global and this module is
    # imported by the grading CLI and the tests. `main()` is not an option either, since
    # `uvicorn runner.main:app` never calls it.
    #
    # WHAT THIS COVERS: this process, and anything it spawns — including the populate
    # lifecycle hooks, which `data/populate/main.py` starts with
    # `asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` and which therefore inherit it.
    #
    # WHAT IT DOES NOT: the `umask 0002` in `populate_hook_with_user.sh.template`,
    # `mcp_launch_with_user.sh.template` and `build_context.py`'s service launches. Those
    # are rendered into `start.sh` and run as SIBLINGS of the runner, so they inherit
    # nothing from here and revert to `0022` if deleted. Only the RUNNER-launch lines are
    # redundant now. Raised in review twice: once because a cleanup that greps
    # `umask 0002` and deletes every hit would break those three silently, and once
    # because an earlier version of this note called the runtime hooks siblings too.
    #
    # Process-wide is the intended scope, not an oversight. It also relaxes files the
    # runner writes elsewhere, but their group is the runner's own (`root`) outside a
    # setgid directory, so no app gains access; inside `/.apps_data/<app>`, whose `2770`
    # supplies the app group, granting it is the point. Scoping it narrower would be

"""Run one grade as a standalone PROCESS, for a Modal Sandbox to boot (RLS-10005).

`python -m runner.grading_entrypoint` takes `GRADING_RUN_ID` / `TRAJECTORY_ID`
from the environment and grades, which is the shape a Sandbox can start and the
shape `runner/k8s_worker.py` and Studio's Docker dispatch already use
(`infra/k8s/gitops/apps/archipelago-grading/`,
`packages/islands/implementations/internal_platform/utils/docker_dispatch.py`).

`run_grading` here is a DELIBERATE COPY of the body in `modal_labs.py`
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Not an oversight, and not the end state. Two functions are now named
`run_grading`, so be precise about which one is untouched: the one in
`modal_labs.py` is byte-identical TO `origin/main` -- that file has a 0-line
diff on this branch. The one in THIS file is the copy, and it is modified (see
the divergences below). All 111 Modal Function lanes keep calling the
`modal_labs.py` one, so nothing here can change a grade that dispatches as a
Function.
That surface is wide (101 verifiers, several reaching live external platforms)
and largely untestable outside production, so it is not worth touching to save
a duplicate. The sandbox path gets its canary from the `GRADING_SANDBOX_DISPATCH`
flag instead, which rolls out one judge model at a time and falls back to the
Function spawn.

The copy costs the one bug this whole design exists to avoid: `k8s_worker.py`
drifted from `run_grading` and silently lost ~15 context vars, taking
LLM-Gateway priority routing, budget metering and spend attribution with it.
`tests/test_grading_entrypoint_parity.py` makes that drift a CI failure rather
than a silent divergence. **If you change one body, change both, and let that
test tell you what you missed.**

TODO(RLS-10005): collapse the duplication -- **THIS FILE SURVIVES.** Delete the
590-line body inside `modal_labs.py` and reduce its `run_grading` to a wrapper
that delegates here (in-body import, never module scope). Do NOT delete this
file: it is what a Sandbox boots, so removing it takes the sandbox path with it.
The TRIGGER is `GRADING_SANDBOX_DISPATCH` reaching
100% and holding for a few days -- at that point this body is already carrying
all batch grading in prod, so pointing the remaining Function lanes at it is
SAFER than leaving them on a body nothing else exercises. Doing it before then
inverts that. `tests/test_grading_entrypoint_parity.py` goes in the same change,
since one body cannot drift from itself. Grep this ticket id for the full set.

WHY THE BODY CANNOT SIMPLY BE IMPORTED FROM `modal_labs.py`
-----------------------------------------------------------
Importing that file builds an image definition and an App, and requires
`modal` -- which a Sandbox has neither reason nor means to pay for. `modal
deploy` also imports it LOCALLY on the deploy runner with only Modal tokens and
no `.env`, which is why every grading import in it sits inside a function body
behind `# import-check-ignore`, and why
`rl-studio/server/linting/modal_deploy_import_checks.py` exists.

THIS MODULE MUST NOT IMPORT `modal`
-----------------------------------
`modal` is NOT a dependency of `archipelago/grading`. CI injects it with
`uv run --with modal`, and `pyproject.toml` excludes the three files that import
it from type-checking for exactly that reason. A Function *container* is handed
the Modal client by the platform whatever the image holds; a **Sandbox is not**,
following from sandboxes being denied Modal credentials by design (confirmed by
Modal, 2026-09-08). `modal_helpers` is already modal-free, so the only two
couplings in this body were `current_function_call_id()` and two exception
types, and both are arguments here. An `import modal` would break the sandbox
at runtime and the type check at desk.

Keep the in-body imports in-body, for the same reason they are in-body there.

    Args:
        grading_run_id: The grading run to run.
        trajectory_id: The trajectory to grade.
        run_handle: Opaque id of whatever is running this, for the log context.
            The Function path passes Modal's current function-call id; the
            sandbox path passes ``MODAL_TASK_ID``. Logged under the key
            ``function_call_id`` on BOTH paths -- the name is kept for
            continuity with every existing Datadog query, so do not rename it
            without checking what filters on it.
        cancelled_exceptions: Exception types to classify as CANCELLED rather
            than ERROR, on top of ``asyncio.CancelledError``, which is always
            included. The Function path passes Modal's ``FunctionTimeoutError``
            and ``InputCancellation``. The sandbox path passes nothing, because
            neither can occur there: a sandbox timeout is exit 124 and a cancel
            is ``terminate()``, so the process dies rather than raising into us.
        read_budget_stop: How to read a budget denial back when saving. Defaults
            to ``budget_stop_ctx``, which is the LANE's channel and must stay
            so. A standalone process has to pass
            ``runner.utils.budget_stop_record.budget_stop`` instead: every
            verifier runs in its own task and ``asyncio.gather`` copies the
            context into each one, so a denial recorded inside the grade is
            invisible to a read outside it, and ``asyncio.run`` copies it again.
            ``runner/utils/llm.py`` sets both channels for exactly this reason.
            Getting this wrong is silent -- the webhook simply omits the stop
            and the batch keeps scheduling grades that will also be denied.

    Raises:
        Whatever the GRADE raised, after saving a terminal status. Re-raised so
        the caller exits non-zero, which is how ``Sandbox.poll()`` reports a
        failed grade.

        NOT a save failure. Those are caught, counted on
        ``studio.grading.save_results_errors``, logged, and swallowed, so a run
        whose grade succeeded but whose save failed still exits 0. That is the
        lane's behaviour too, faithfully copied; the dead-container sweep is
        what catches such a run, since it reaps any exited sandbox whose row is
        still active. Fixing it means changing both bodies at once, which is
        owed by RLS-10925 (where they become one).

# Always needed: the ids to grade, and where to report the result.

# The webhook pair is here for the SILENT failure, which is the worse of the two
# this function guards. `runner/save/services/webhook.py` logs a warning and
# RETURNS when either is unset, so without them a grade downloads its snapshots,
# runs every verifier, spends the judge-LLM budget, exits 0, and writes nothing
# -- `Sandbox.poll()` then reports a successful grade that produced no result,
# and the run sits active until the dead-container sweep reaps it. The OIDC pair
# below at least raises. Not hypothetical on a preview deploy either: the
# grading App overrides SAVE_WEBHOOK_URL through an app-level Secret, which a
# Sandbox does not inherit unless its creator passes it (RLS-10005). k8s and
# Docker set both as well, so requiring them costs those paths nothing.

# about the platform. `MODAL_IS_REMOTE` is what `_get_s3_session` itself keys on
# to choose between raising and falling back, but nothing in this repo SETS it
# -- every occurrence is a read -- so whether Modal sets it inside a Sandbox as
# it does in a Function container is not something the code can answer.
# `MODAL_TASK_ID` is the second: already load-bearing in this file for
# `run_handle` below, on the same understanding that Modal sets it in every
# container it runs. `MODAL_SANDBOX_ID` is the third, added because review
# reported that Modal sets the task and sandbox ids inside a Sandbox while
# MODAL_IS_REMOTE is documented for Function containers -- which, if right,
# means the single-signal version of this check was silent in every sandbox,
# the exact case it exists for.
#
# Requiring the pair when ANY is present means the check only goes quiet if all
# three are absent. None exists off Modal, so the k8s/Docker fallback is
# untouched. Raised by review on #21672, in three passes: the signal set, then
# the trimming, then which variables may be trimmed at all.
# MODAL_IS_REMOTE is tested UNTRIMMED, exactly as `_get_s3_session` tests it
# (`modal_helpers.py:173`). That is deliberate and it is the whole point: this
# preflight must never be LOOSER than the thing it protects. Trimming it made
# a whitespace-only value read as off-Modal here while the consumer still read
# it as on-Modal and raised -- so the grade started and died opaquely inside
# the first snapshot download, which is what the preflight exists to prevent.

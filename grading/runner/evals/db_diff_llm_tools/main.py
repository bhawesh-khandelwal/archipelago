"""DB Diff LLM Tools Judge - evaluates database changes against criteria using tool-augmented LLM.

Instead of dumping the entire DB diff into a single prompt (which fails on large diffs),
this verifier gives the LLM tools to lazily explore the diff data:
- inspect_table: get column names and row counts for a table
- get_rows: paginated access to specific changed rows
- search_rows: substring search over the COMPLETE changed-row set of a table
  (including rows beyond the materialized row-body cap)
- run_python: execute arbitrary Python against the diff data
- submit_verdict: terminate with pass/fail

The LLM starts with a compact summary and drills into relevant tables on demand.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are evaluating database changes against specific criteria.

You have tools to explore the database diff. The diff may be very large,
so do NOT try to load all data at once. Instead:

1. Review the summary of changes provided (table names and row counts)
2. Use inspect_table to check column names for relevant tables
3. Use get_rows to examine specific changes that matter for the criteria
4. Use search_rows to check whether a value exists ANYWHERE in a table's
   changes — it searches the complete diff data, including rows beyond the
   materialized cap in truncated tables
5. Use run_python if you need to filter, aggregate, or search across the data
6. Call submit_verdict once you have enough evidence

Be efficient — only inspect tables and rows relevant to the evaluation criteria.
Focus on what the criteria asks for and gather just enough evidence to decide.

IMPORTANT: get_rows and run_python only see the materialized row bodies, which
are capped per table. For tables marked as truncated (rows_truncated from
inspect_table, or "row bodies capped" in the summary), absence from
get_rows/run_python output is NOT evidence of absence — you MUST confirm with
search_rows before concluding a value is missing from such a table. In the
rare case that search_rows itself reports it cannot search the complete data
(searched_complete_data=false), that table is genuinely inconclusive for the
value — do not retry; note the limitation in your rationale and decide from
the exact counts and the materialized rows you do have.

**Stop searching and submit fail immediately if any of the following are true:**
- A table that must contain the expected change shows 0 rows of the relevant change type (added, deleted, or modified) in the summary
- A search_rows call on the relevant table returns no matches for the key field or value
- On a non-truncated table only: you have made 3+ queries with the same approach and found nothing matching the criteria, or a run_python search returned no results for the key field or value

Do not try alternative phrasings, different offsets, or related tables after a clear
negative result. Absence of the expected data IS the evidence — submit fail immediately."""

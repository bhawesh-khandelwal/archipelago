    # before the guard existed / on a lane it cannot reach (empty_response_loop).
    #
    # Graded as a genuine model failure: score 0.0, status OK -- NOT a harness ERROR.
    # Team decision (2026-08-14, #eval-flywheel): a refusal is the model's own
    # behaviour and belongs in the score rather than being excluded from it. The flags
    # keep it filterable for anyone analysing refusal rate separately.
    #
    # The 0 is ASSERTED, not read. harbor only continues to the verifier phase for
    # AgentTimeoutError / NonZeroAgentExitCodeError (trial/single_step.py:83), so a
    # guard-stopped trial has no verifier result -- without this branch it would fall
    # through to "Missing Lighthouse score" and be excluded, which is the opposite of
    # counting it. Asserting 0 is sound: the model emitted nothing, so nothing it did
    # could pass, and both observed looped trajectories scored 0 from the verifier too.
    #
    # A guard-stopped trial reaches this code only because the agent promotes it from
    # FAILED to COMPLETED (lighthouse_code_agent/main.py:_assemble_output) -- Studio
    # queues grading for COMPLETED alone. Leave that promotion in place or this branch
    # goes back to being dead code for the shape it was written for.
    #
    # Checked FIRST -- ahead of both the eval_status and timeout branches:
    #
    #  * ahead of eval_status: a guard-stopped trial has an exception and no verifier
    #    result, which is exactly the condition the harbor adapter maps to
    #    EvalStatus.FAILED (harnesses/harbor/adapter.py:3352-3357). Behind that branch
    #    this code is unreachable for the very trials it exists for, and they keep
    #    being excluded as "harness failed before the agent could run" -- which is
    #    also untrue. Caught in review by both Devin and Cursor.
    #  * ahead of the timeout branch: a refusal loop can exhaust the agent budget and
    #    be recorded as an ordinary timeout, so the root cause must win over the
    #    symptom.
    #
    # A genuine harness failure sets neither flag, so it still falls through to the
    # eval_status branch below.

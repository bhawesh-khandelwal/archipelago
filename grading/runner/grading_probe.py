"""Candidate-snapshot synthesis for the high-fidelity grading probe.

The server sends the probe a battery of *candidate specs* (label / kind /
source); this module turns each spec into the ``final_snapshot_bytes`` the real
grader diffs against the base, plus the ``FINAL_ANSWER`` text carried on the
synthetic trajectory. It is pure stdlib (``io`` + ``zipfile``) so it is
unit-testable offline, with no Modal / grader dependency.

Two rules from the SPEC (§4) drive the shapes here:

- **A candidate's final snapshot is ``base ∪ deliverable``, never the deliverable
  alone.** The grader diffs the candidate against the task's base (initial) env;
  a snapshot holding only the deliverable would diff as "the agent deleted the
  entire environment". So every candidate overlays its deliverable onto a copy
  of the base members.
- **A degradation must change a file's size or path.** A same-size, same-path
  edit to a non-tabular file diffs as UNCHANGED and is never graded. ``truncate``
  / ``empty_file`` change size; ``drop_key_file`` changes the path set.

Snapshot layout: a ``ZIP_STORED`` zip whose deliverable files live under
``filesystem/`` (member names preserved verbatim). ``filesystem/answer.txt`` is
the conventional text-answer file; a text golden materialized there is read back
as the golden's ``FINAL_ANSWER``.

"""Extract paragraph, font, numbering, and tracked-change metadata from a DOCX.

The dict-returning extractor is a domain-specific utility used by the
docx_style_verifier_apex_v2 eval. docx_to_style_metadata_output wraps it as a
registered transformation for the generic multi-representation judge, emitting
a bounded run/table/chart style summary rather than the full dict.

The output is consumed by an LLM judge in `text` mode. Tracked changes are
preserved (not stripped) so style criteria can grade redline hygiene.

See ../README.md for the rules these extractors share: resolve references to
the value that renders, name the source, never invent one, and cap every
section with the cap disclosed.

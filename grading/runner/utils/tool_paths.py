"""Resolve the external binaries a verifier shells out to.

``GRADING_TOOLS_PREFIX`` names the directory a consumer read the staged tools
at. Unset, this returns None and the caller leaves the tool to PATH, which is
what the grading lane wants: apt put poppler there.

Set, it is a claim that the toolchain was mounted, and a tool missing under it
is a misconfiguration. This raises instead of returning None, because PATH in a
world's platform image has no poppler and the failure that follows is quiet:
``pdf_to_base64_images`` catches ``Exception`` and returns no images, so a
grade would be scored against a document the judge could not see. Raising costs
a grade, which the controller then dispatches to the lane. Returning None would
cost a wrong score.

The value is whatever path the mount landed at. Nothing in the staged tree
carries a compiled-in path, so it runs from any of them.

Unset AND mounted beside this source, the tree is found by its position
relative to this file, which is also how ``running_from_a_mount`` tells a mount
from a container of our own. Position rather than a variable because ``POST
/grade`` does NOT strip the environment: the grade subprocess gets the
sandbox's own, minus ``PYTHONPATH`` and the grading-credential names, so a
value baked into a world image arrives here, and falling through to PATH on a
mount is the quiet-wrong case above.

One thing the tree cannot place itself: poppler reads its CMaps from a
compile-time ``/usr/share/poppler`` and honours no environment variable, so the
consumer that mounts this also has to present ``tools/poppler/share/poppler``
there. ``verify_staged_tools`` checks it did, because a PDF with a predefined
CJK encoding otherwise renders differently from the lane and nothing says so.

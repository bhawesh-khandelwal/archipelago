    the reserved estimate rather than $0 — real spend is never counted free (BugBot).

    ``creation_ttl`` is the TTL the request's cache markers actually carried.
    Both existing rate paths land on the 5-minute figure — ``lookup_model_rates``

    ``cache_creation_input_token_cost``, and the fallback below is ``in_rate *

    every Anthropic model in the map that does define it.

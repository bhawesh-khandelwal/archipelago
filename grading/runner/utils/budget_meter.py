"""Per-cost-unit LLM spend meter, backed by Redis — the shared guardrail core.

CANONICAL SOURCE — vendored verbatim into the archipelago and pipelines runners by
``scripts/vendor_budget_meter.py`` (parity-tested); edit only this file.
Client-injected: every op takes an async Redis client (or ``None``) so the three
consumers (server, agents runner, grading runner) pass their own.

Model: the Postgres ``budget_state`` column is the source of truth; Redis is a 2-day cache.
``budget_total:{unit}`` holds the cap, ``tc:<lane>:{unit}`` accrues real cost per settled
call for each lane in ``LANES`` (mirrored to Postgres via GREATEST),
``est:untracked:{unit}`` is a side ledger for unreadable-usage calls,
``settled:{unit}:{cid}`` dedupes retried accruals, ``hydrate_lock:{unit}`` dedupes
runner-triggered repair. remaining = total − Σ lanes, always derived (never stored).
Keys are hash-tagged ``{unit}`` and hydrated from the mirror on miss (see server).

Key convention: ``<kind>:<qualifier...>:{unit}`` — colon-delimited so a new workload is a
new lane token in ``LANES``, not a new key format. ``unit`` is a trajectory batch id today;
nothing in this module assumes that.

Absent vs unenforced: a MISSING cap key means "Redis lost state, rehydrate"; a cap of
``UNENFORCED_MICROS`` means "no budget was ever set". Conflating them would make every
unbudgeted batch look like an eviction forever, so ``hydrate`` always writes one or the
other and every tracked key (never a bare skip) — that makes "all keys present" an
invariant the runner can test with ``BudgetSnapshot.hydration_needed``.

Fail-open: ops retry only on Redis *service* errors (never a valid response), then
degrade toward "no guardrail" with a DD-alertable ``_note_redis_error`` log.

    ``request_hydration`` is injected so this module keeps its runner-safe dependency set
    (redis/pydantic/loguru) — it must never learn about HTTP or server config.

    Fail-open, and broadly so: this sits on the per-LLM-call path, where raising would fail
    a real customer call to protect a best-effort repair. The whole body is guarded, not
    just the request — a snapshot of an unexpected shape or a client that does not
    implement SET NX must degrade to "no repair requested", never propagate. The sweep
    remains the backstop.

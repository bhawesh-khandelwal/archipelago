    A ``str | Iterable`` union validates into a pydantic ValidatorIterator
    (pydantic/pydantic#9541) that yields once. Every verifier of a run shares
    the message and they are gathered concurrently, so whichever reads first
    must restore what it drained — otherwise the next one reads an empty
    sequence and grades a blank conversation. Call this before serializing.

    The read-drain-writeback is not atomic, and it does not need to be *today*:
    the dispatch gathers coroutines (``runner/main.py``) with no ``to_thread``,
    and nothing here awaits, so no other verifier can observe the half-drained
    message. Both halves of that are load-bearing — an ``await`` inside this
    function, or a dispatch that moves to threads, reintroduces the interleaving
    this exists to prevent.

    A plain string validates into an iterator over its characters, so those are
    rejoined. ``"".join`` is right for that and only that: a concrete list is
    returned untouched above, and the content union's iterable branch is over
    block objects, so a list of bare strings does not survive validation. An
    all-strings drain therefore can only have come from a string. dict and bytes
    are iterable but yield keys and ints, so they are left alone, as are values
    that are already concrete.

    A block the union does not cover raises partway through the drain. What came
    out before the raise is already gone from the iterator, so the prefix is
    written back rather than discarded — leaving a spent iterator in place would
    hand the next verifier the truncated remainder, which is the same blank
    conversation reached by a raise instead of by a read.

    That write-back is lossy on purpose, and the loss is worth naming: for an
    ``[text, tool_use]`` turn whose ``tool_use`` block the union rejects, the
    text survives and the ``tool_use`` does not, so a later reader that inspects
    non-text blocks sees a one-element list. The alternative is a spent iterator,
    which gives every later reader nothing at all — recovering the text beats
    losing the turn, and the warning records that it happened.

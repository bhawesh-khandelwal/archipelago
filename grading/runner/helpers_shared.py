# SNAPSHOT_DIFF consumers (file_diff_check, content_length_check, jupiter_*,

# content, so their presence disables the optimization entirely.
#
# The two visual evals belong here as well. They apply the same
# ``expected_file_type`` filter, and their extra steps — rendering a document as
# page images, and fetching reference artifacts — read bytes straight from the
# snapshot zips (transform_output_artifacts reads the final zip,
# fetch_artifacts_with_transformations the initial one), never from the diff's
# text content. OUTPUT_LLM_WEIGHTED_WITH_VLM is a wrapper that forwards to
# OUTPUT_LLM_MULTI_REPRESENTATION with visual grading on, so one argument covers

#                                    FINAL database state and reads SNAPSHOT_DBS.

#
# _DB_TARGET_HELPERS below is the single place that routing lives.
#
# NEITHER helper is a static dependency of these evals: DB_DIFF scans both
# snapshots and diffs SQLite/SQL-dump/JSON data, and SNAPSHOT_DBS extracts every
# database out of the final snapshot — so running either on every output_llm
# grade (the most common verifier) would be wasteful. Each is collected only
# when a verifier selects the matching target — see needs_db_diff() /
# needs_snapshot_dbs().
#
# OUTPUT_LLM_WEIGHTED_WITH_VLM inherits the delegation: it forwards to
# OUTPUT_LLM_MULTI_REPRESENTATION, which routes both database targets onward.
# Without the entry here the helper is never collected, and the delegate fails
# closed — score 0.0, "No database diff/state was available to evaluate." Its
# Grading Target dropdown omits the database options, so only an API-authored or
